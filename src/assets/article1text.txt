Hello and welcome to DOSS Blog, Doug's Open Source Software Blog. This is the first article, 
and if you can read this, it means my blog is working! There are several things I will be 
talking about on this blog, such as electronics projects, coding, and some other computer 
science topics. I am very excited about this, and if you possibly could, when I get my patreon/ 
donation method set up, please donate. If you want, you don't  have to, I currently don't need 
any money. Just so you know, and I will be talking about this in the next article, but I think 
that linux is, by far, the best operating system. In fact, right now I am writing this article 
on a laptop that I installed Ubuntu on. I also like Raspberry Pi (not the edible kind) for their 
cheap and affordable computers, I have about 10 raspberry pi zeros alone, and two pi 5s, one is 
my home server, that, as of now, is only running PiHole (the DNS adblocker). The other one I use 
as my main computer. I love self-hosting and open source software, and that is where I got the 
blog name from. By the way, I am Doug, and I probably will not have made any of the software I 
talk about on this blog, though I hope to become better at software development. Just a bit of 
credit where credit is due, this blog was inspired by the Hackaday blog, just thought I'd shout
them out. That is all for today.
